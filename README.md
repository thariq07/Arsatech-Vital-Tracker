# Real-time Health Monitoring System using ESP32 & Python Visualization  

ðŸ’¡ **Internship Project at Arsatechnology**  

This project is a real-time health monitoring system that captures and visualizes biometric sensor data using the **ESP32 Wroom DA**. Designed for efficiency and accuracy, it seamlessly integrates hardware and software for continuous health tracking.  

### ðŸ”§ **Key Features:**  
âœ… **ESP32 (Arduino IDE):** Reads biometric sensor data and transmits it via serial communication.  
âœ… **Python Visualization:** Processes incoming data and dynamically displays it using **Matplotlib** for a professional, medical-style live graph.  
âœ… **Real-time Monitoring:** Ensures smooth and responsive updates for an interactive user experience.  

ðŸš€ **Perfect for IoT health applications, biomedical research, and smart monitoring solutions!**
